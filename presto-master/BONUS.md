### Bonus

- implemented dark mode and made it consistent across screens
    - text, screens, buttons, colours all invert themselves appropriately
    - choice of dark mode is saved per browser, if you open it up again it remembers your choice
- clicking logo navigates to dashboard
- clicking slide thumbnail takes you to each slide, each slide is highlighted when you’re on it
- beautiful n responsive layout (surely that counts for something?!)
- added preview for adding images so users can check if they've uploaded the right image
- autohighlights code, but users can also manually change the code language (so if the highlight is wrong they can change it)

also I know presentation.jsx is way too big but I kinda ran out of time to refactor I'm so sorry please be lenient :'o
