- simple, straightforward and consistent layout across pages (i.e dashboard and presentation)
- accessible colours, ensured there was enough contrast between colours in both light and dark mode (e.g. no white on grey text)
- added alt text to most non-text content such as modals and images

```jsx
<StyledLogo src={myLogo} alt='My Logo' />
```

- added aria labels to modals

```jsx
<ModalDialog
              aria-labelledby='delete-presentation-title'
              aria-describedby='delete-presentation-description'
```

- all page actions support keyboard interactions
    - for example, all modals/buttons support enter in addition to clicking and tapping
    - users can navigate between interactive elements using tab buttons
    - users can use both arrow keys or on screen arrows to navigate between slides
- for modals and forms, I've used the appropriate form elements like form, labels, inputs etc.
    - inputs use autocomplete when appropriate
    - errors are communicated clearly by text and symbol
- no time-based elements so sufficient time for users to complete tasks
- responsive design for both mobile and desktop users
    - no horizontal scrolling
    - can support different orientations
- all modals can be exited by clicking outside or by clicking close buttons
- media does not autoplay
    - users can choose between autoplay and non-autoplay for adding videos
    - videos can be paused and have captions
- All modals textboxes have simple and clear instructions (no empty text boxes with no labels on them)
